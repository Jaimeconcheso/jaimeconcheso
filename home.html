        AUGUST 2023

        I am currently working towards my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
        Recently, I was thrilled to be chosen from more than 900 applicants for an exchange program at 
        the top-ranked university in Asia, the National University of Singapore (NUS).

        Moving 15,000 kilometers away from home is a big change, but my love for learning and curiosity about
        new cultures made it an easy decision. Being in Singapore for a whole year gives me a fantastic
        opportunity to grow personally and professionally. I look forward to making the most of what NUS
        has to offer and embracing the rich learning experiences that await me there.

        JUNE 2023 - JULY 2023

        This summer, I had the exciting opportunity to join the Data Analytics & Pricing department at
        TotalEnergies as a Data Analyst Intern. Over a 6-week period, I immersed myself in the
        energetic environment of a leading energy company, where learning and real-world application went
        hand in hand.

        At TotalEnergies, my day-to-day involved digging into client preferences retrieving data from 
        SAS-Guide to shape sharper marketing strategies. I also got to master my skills in MS Power BI, 
        creating visual reports that showcased five years of sales data into actionable insights. A 
        highlight was presenting these findings to my manager, turning numbers into narratives that 
        could drive our future strategies.
        
        Looking back at my time at TotalEnergies, I can say it was really something special. I learned a
        lot, met great people, and got a real feel for the job I was doing. It wasn't just about picking
        up new skills, but also about making connections and finding my way in the professional world. I
        walked away with not just a better understanding of the industry but also with a bunch of new friends
        in my corner.

        SEPT 2022 - MAY 2023

        I spent this academic year as a Powertrain Engineer with the Edinburgh University Formula Student 
        (EUFS) team. It was all about teamwork, learning quickly, and jumping headfirst into exciting projects.
        
        In my role, I took on the big task of building a DC Link Box for our FS-AI car, starting with zero 
        knowledge but learning tons along the way. I also got to lead some, making sure our team was always 
        on the same page and hitting our deadlines. I spended a lot of time sending emails too, talking to 
        different providers to get what we needed for our car design — a real lesson in how to communicate 
        and negotiate. And it all paid off when we won big at the Formula Student 2023 Awards, bringing home 
        a whole load of trophies from a worldwide competition!
        
        Looking back, I see how much I grew, not just in knowing how to build stuff but in working well with others 
        and getting things done as a team. It wasn't just about the technical bits; it was about pulling together 
        and going for the win, which we did, big time!

        SEPT 2022 - MAY 2023

        While working at the Spanish Society (SpanSoc) at the University of Edinburgh, I had a great time teaming 
        up with 11 other people who were as enthusiastic as I was. Even though I was the Sports Director, we all 
        chipped in to help each other out.

        My main job was to handle everything sports-related, creating football and basketball teams from scratch 
        and looking after more than 60 people. It was all about setting up training sessions every week and getting 
        games going every weekend. But that wasn't all, I also arranged places for us to have our events, talked to 
        companies to get us deals on sports gear, and kept a close eye on our budget, making sure we spent our money 
        wisely.

        Looking back, I'm really glad I did it. Yes, it took up a lot of my time, but being a part of SpanSoc was 
        totally worth it. We worked hard to welcome all kinds of people and to make sure everyone behaved well. 
        The best part? Helping people feel at home at the University of Edinburgh, making their time there just 
        that bit better.

        AUGUST 2022

        Back in August 2022, I joined the team at Grupo Intermark as a Software Developer. It was 
        a busy time, but super rewarding.

        One of my big tasks was working on web scraping. If you're wondering, web scraping is a way 
        to grab lots of info from websites automatically. I used this to get data from all the Spanish 
        provinces — yeah, all 50 of them! It was crucial stuff for helping plan political campaigns.

        The job really kept me active and encouraged me to learn quickly. And it wasn't all just about 
        learning new tech skills. I had the chance to team up with some really experienced developers, 
        which helped me get better at communicating, both when writing and just chatting with the team.

        It was a great experience, mixing learning with doing, and seeing firsthand how tech can power 
        big projects.

        Last year, I went to Fort Portal in Uganda to help out with Volcop ONG. A big part of my job 
        was helping to build a community center so local kids can go to school. I also spent time at 
        orphanages, taking care of the children there. Apart from that, I had the chance to teach maths,
        English, and geography at a local school. Every day was a lesson in being strong, keeping hope 
        alive, and working together as a community. The kids I met were full of spirit and taught me 
        that kindness can speak louder than words and can bring people together, no matter where they 
        are from.

        SEPT 2021 - PRESENT

        Two years ago, right after my A-levels, I joined the University of Edinburgh to study Electrical 
        and Electronics Engineering. Everyone knows it's a great university, and starting there was a big, 
        exciting step for me.

        Now, being here and looking back, I am really happy about my choice. I've been learning a lot and 
        I'm eager to see where my education takes me in the future.
