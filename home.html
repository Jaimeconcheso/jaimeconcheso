        AUGUST 2023

        I am currently working towards my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
        Recently, I was thrilled to be chosen from more than 900 applicants for an exchange program at 
        the top-ranked university in Asia, the National University of Singapore (NUS).

        Moving 15,000 kilometers away from home is a big change, but my love for learning and curiosity about
        new cultures made it an easy decision. Being in Singapore for a whole year gives me a fantastic
        opportunity to grow personally and professionally. I look forward to making the most of what NUS
        has to offer and embracing the rich learning experiences that await me there.

        During my time working at the Spanish Society (SpanSoc) at the University of Edinburgh,
        one of the largest international societies in the institution, I had the oportunity to work with
        11 like-minded individuals. My role was Sports Director, however, everyone help and support each
        other. I had to make two teams, one of football and the other one of basketball, taking care of
        more than 60 people. I had to scheduled weekly trainings and arrange matches every weekend.
        
        Moerover, my role was not just about sports. I also had to speak with different venues in order
        to host events. I had to maintain conversation with various companies to get sponsorship for the 
        sports equipment. I also professionalized my excel skills as I had to keep track of all the money
        spent by the society in terms of hiring venues, booking fields, memebership payments and so on.
        
        In summary, although being part of the Spanish committe took me a long part of my time, I can not 
        be more happy to have been part of a society like this. I think we did our best to foment diversity
        and foster a culture of good conduct. And the most important thing, we help lots of people getting
        integrated in their university life and having a better time at The University of Edinburgh.

        Last year, I went to Fort Portal in Uganda to help out with Volcop ONG. A big part of my job 
        was helping to build a community center so local kids can go to school. I also spent time at 
        orphanages, taking care of the children there. Apart from that, I had the chance to teach maths,
        English, and geography at a local school. Every day was a lesson in being strong, keeping hope 
        alive, and working together as a community. The kids I met were full of spirit and taught me 
        that kindness can speak louder than words and can bring people together, no matter where they 
        are from.
