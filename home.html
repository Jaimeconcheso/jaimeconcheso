        AUGUST 2023

        I am currently working towards my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
        Recently, I was thrilled to be chosen from more than 900 applicants for an exchange program at 
        the top-ranked university in Asia, the National University of Singapore (NUS). This selection is 
        not just a nod to my academic efforts so far but also a golden ticket to dive deeper into my field 
        surrounded by the best minds in the industry.

        Moving 15,000 kilometers away from home is a big leap, but my love for learning and curiosity about
        new cultures made it an easy decision. Being in Singapore for a whole year gives me a fantastic
        opportunity to grow personally and professionally. I look forward to making the most of what NUS
        has to offer and embracing the rich learning experiences that await me there.

        During my time working at the Spanish Society (SpanSoc) at the University of Edinburgh,
        one of the largest international societies in the institution, I had the enriching opportunity
        to immerse myself in the vibrant and diverse world of Spanish culture. Being part of a committee
        constituted by 12 passionate undergraduate students, I found myself continuously inspired and 
        motivated to foster a sense of community and belonging among our over 200 associates and members. 
        Whether we wereorganizing exhilarating reggaeton parties, engaging in sports tournaments, or 
        channeling the essential Spanish festive spirit through various club nights, every event was a 
        canvas of joy, learning, and culturaL exchange. 
        
        It was an invigorating experience to work closely with different cultural and sports societies, 
        as we curated a space where every individual, irrespective of their background, could celebrate 
        and appreciate the Spanish culture in its full glory. I took great pride in helping facilitate 
        an environment where people could not only revel in the Spanish traditions but also create 
        everlasting memories and forge lifelong friendships. It was not just about the grandeur of the 
        events, but the smiles we brought to faces, the understanding we fostered, and the family we built
        away from home, showcasing the warm and welcoming spirit of the Spanish culture.

        Last year, I went to Fort Portal in Uganda to help out with Volcop ONG. A big part of my job 
        was helping to build a community center so local kids can go to school. I also spent time at 
        orphanages, taking care of the children there. Apart from that, I had the chance to teach maths,
        English, and geography at a local school. Every day was a lesson in being strong, keeping hope 
        alive, and working together as a community. The kids I met were full of spirit and taught me 
        that kindness can speak louder than words and can bring people together, no matter where they 
        are from.
