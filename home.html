        Hello there! Welcome to my space. I'm Jaime Concheso, and right now, I'm working my way 
        through a Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

        Here, I share my personal experiences and the milestones in my journey so far. It's 
        a straightforward look at the things I've learned and the moments that stand out.

        Feel free to explore, and reach out if you'd like to chat or learn more. Thanks for 
        stopping by!

        AUGUST 2023

        I am currently working towards my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
        Recently, I was thrilled to be chosen from more than 900 applicants for an exchange program at 
        the top-ranked university in Asia, the National University of Singapore (NUS).

        Moving 15,000 kilometers away from home is a big change, but my love for learning and curiosity about
        new cultures made it an easy decision. Being in Singapore for a whole year gives me a fantastic
        opportunity to grow personally and professionally. I look forward to making the most of what NUS
        has to offer and embracing the rich learning experiences that await me there.

        JUNE 2023 - JULY 2023

        This summer, I had the exciting opportunity to join the Data Analytics & Pricing department at
        TotalEnergies as a Data Analyst Intern. Over a 6-week period, I immersed myself in the
        energetic environment of a leading energy company, where learning and real-world application went
        hand in hand.

        At TotalEnergies, I had a busy but rewarding role where I spent my time understanding what our 
        clients liked and used that information to help make our marketing better. Using a tool called 
        SAS-Guide, I would gather important data and then use another tool, MS Power BI, to create clear 
        and easy-to-understand reports.

        A big moment for me was when I got to show these reports to my managers. It was really great to 
        take all those numbers and turn them into a story that helped us figure out our next steps. It 
        felt good knowing I was helping shape what we do next
        
        Looking back at my time at TotalEnergies, I can say it was really something special. I learned a
        lot, met great people, and got a real feel for the job I was doing. It wasn't just about picking
        up new skills, but also about making connections and finding my way in the professional world. I
        walked away with not just a better understanding of the industry but also with a bunch of new friends
        in my corner.

        SEPT 2022 - MAY 2023

        I spent last academic year as a Powertrain Engineer with the Edinburgh University Formula 
        Student (EUFS) team. It was all about teamwork, learning quickly, and jumping headfirst 
        into exciting projects.
        
        In my job, I was given the important task of creating a DC Link Box for our FS-AI car 
        (Autonomous car). I started not knowing much but learned a huge amount as I went along. 
        Part of my role was to keep the team organized, making sure we were all working together 
        well and meeting our deadlines. A big part of the job was sending lots of emails to different 
        companies to get the parts we needed for our car, which taught me how to communicate and 
        negotiate effectively.

        The best part was seeing our hard work pay off. We competed in the Formula Student 2023 
        Awards and won many awards, showing that all our effort was worth it!
        
        Looking back, I see how much I grew, not just in knowing how to build stuff but in working 
        well with others and getting things done as a team. It wasn't just about the technical bits; 
        it was about pulling together and going for the win, which we did, big time!

        SEPT 2022 - MAY 2023

        While working at the Spanish Society (SpanSoc) at the University of Edinburgh, I had a great 
        time teaming up with 11 other people who were as enthusiastic as I was. Even though I was 
        the Sports Director, we all chipped in to help each other out.

        My main job was to handle everything sports-related, creating football and basketball teams 
        from scratch and looking after more than 60 people. It was all about setting up training 
        sessions every week and getting games going every weekend. But that wasn't all, I also 
        arranged places for us to have our events, talked to companies to get us deals on sports 
        equipment, and kept a close eye on our budget, making sure we spent our money wisely.

        Looking back, I'm really glad I did it. Yes, it took up a lot of my time, but being a part 
        of SpanSoc was totally worth it. We worked hard to welcome all kinds of people and to make 
        sure everyone behaved well. The best part? Helping people feel at home at the University of 
        Edinburgh, making their time there just that bit better.

        AUGUST 2022

        Back in August 2022, I joined the team at Grupo Intermark as a Software Developer. It was 
        a busy time, but super rewarding.

        One of my big tasks was working on web scraping. If you're wondering, web scraping is a way 
        to grab lots of info from websites automatically. I used this to get data from all the Spanish 
        provinces — yeah, all 50 of them! It was crucial stuff for helping plan political campaigns.

        The job really kept me active and encouraged me to learn quickly. And it wasn't all just about 
        learning new tech skills. I had the chance to team up with some really experienced developers, 
        which helped me get better at communicating, both when writing and just chatting with the team.

        It was a great experience, mixing learning with doing, and seeing firsthand how tech can power 
        big projects.

        Last year, I had the amazing opportunity to travel to Fort Portal in Uganda to volunteer 
        alongside Volcop ONG. It was a time of hard work and coming together to do something 
        truly important for the local kids.

        Every day was busy and rewarding. I helped build a community center, a place where kids will be 
        able to learn and grow. But it wasn't just about building; I also spent time caring for children 
        in orphanages, making sure they were safe and happy. I got to teach them maths, English, and 
        geography too, sharing knowledge and learning from them as well.
        
        Looking back, I learned so much from the experience. The kids taught me that with hope and 
        teamwork, anything is possible. It was a lesson in kindness and the beautiful things that 
        can happen when people come together to help each other. It's an experience I will carry with 
        me always, a reminder of the good we can do when we work with love and unity.

        SEPT 2021 - PRESENT

        Two years ago, right after my A-levels, I joined the University of Edinburgh to study Electrical 
        and Electronics Engineering. Everyone knows it's a great university, and starting there was a big, 
        exciting step for me.

        Now, being here and looking back, I am really happy about my choice. I've been learning a lot and 
        I'm eager to see where my education takes me in the future.
